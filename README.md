# RecipesAngApp

## Project Description

Created as part of a job application, this Angular Website involves calling a JSON API from TheMealDB to display a fully designed set of meals. Angular routing is then used to navigate across the site and view the preparation details of the recipes. TSLint has been used in an attempt to ensure adherence to
coding standards.

The design of the website has been done using pure HTML5 and CSS and the UI design is entirely my own, done from scratch, without any external templates or references. The code in the initial commit was completed from scratch in 24 hours of work. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
